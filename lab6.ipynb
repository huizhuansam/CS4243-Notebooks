    "#### Goal of this section:\n",
    "- Learn how to track feature points using the *Lucas-Kanade algorithm* in the `lucas_kanade_point_tracking` function.\n",
    "- Learn how to draw the tracked points and the motion vectors on each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The tracking continues until you press the `'Esc'` key to exit the application.\n",
    "    - Make sure that the path to your video file is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Extra:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - You can configure the code to use your camera as the video source.\n",
    "    - You might need to adjust the parameters for good feature point detection (e.g., `cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack`) to suit your specific tracking needs."

    "- So, in the provided function, only the path to the video file is needed.\n",
    "- However, if you want to access a different camera or live stream, you might use a different argument, typically an integer (like 0 for the default camera). In some situations, you might also want to set other properties of the `VideoCapture` object using the `set()` method, but these are not parameters of the `VideoCapture` function itself.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Q6** - How can we read a live video stream?\n",
    "> - **Answer:**\n",
    "- To read a live video stream using OpenCV's `VideoCapture` function, you would typically pass an integer representing the camera's ID.\n",
    "- For most systems, `0` would be the default built-in camera (like a laptop's webcam). `1` would be a secondary camera if connected, and so on.\n",

    "- The `maxCorners` parameter determines the maximum number of corners or feature points to return.\n",

    "> - **Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `qualityLevel` parameter is a multiplier for the minimum eigenvalue of a 2x2 normal matrix of optical flow equations, the smallest eigenvalue of which is used to sort the corners. In simpler terms, it sets the threshold for the quality of the corners.\n",
    "- If set to 0.9: The function will be stricter in determining which corners are considered \"good\". It will only select corners that have a quality score greater than 90% of the highest quality corner detected. As a result, you might end up with fewer corners than the specified maxCorners value, unless there are many very high-quality corners.\n",
    "- If set to 0.01: The function will be more lenient, and you'll get many more corners, potentially up to your `maxCorners` limit, but many of these corners might not be very prominent or distinct.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Q10** - The `minDistance` parameter is the minimum distance between detected feature points in pixel. What if changing it to `1` and `50`?\n",
    "> - **Answer:** \n",
    "- The `minDistance` parameter defines the minimum Euclidean distance between the returned corners.\n",
    "- If set to 1: Detected corners can be very close to each other, with a minimum distance of 1 pixel between them. This might result in clusters of points in regions with high texture.\n",
    "- If set to 50: Detected corners will be at least 50 pixels apart from each other. This ensures that the corners are well distributed over the image, but in small or tightly textured regions, you might miss out on potential feature points because of this larger distance constraint.\n",
