# CS4243 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition [Lab Notebooks]

Taken AY23/24 Semester 1

Amidst my struggle to understand what the hell is going on for this course at week 9, I have decided to rework the labs.

The organisation of my lecturer's teaching materials is basically nonexistent, so I had to do some cleanup and reorganisation myself. This includes but is not limited to: renaming variables and functions to actually mean something instead of some cryptic `i`, `j`, `k`, `L3L3` (???) etc., consolidating sample images used in the labs that are arbitrarily scattered on Canvas and my TA's Github repo, and renaming filepaths to point to my local directory instead of my TA's hard drive.

I also added explanatory comments for shit that doesn't make sense in the notebooks. I felt that it is necessary because the structure of the notebooks are just terrible and has left me very confused after each lab session.

## Setup
I use VSCode to work on the notebooks. Select a conda kernel and install the packages and dependencies as prompted. Be sure to restart the kernel after installing the dependencies to get intellisense + autocomplete.

## Issues
`cv2.imshow()` causes the Python kernel to crash on my laptop. I can't be bothered to fix it, so I just used `matplotlib.pyplot` to render the output instead.

_Disclaimer: all images, videos, and notebooks are created/curated by Dr. Amirhassan Monajemi. I do not own any part of this._
